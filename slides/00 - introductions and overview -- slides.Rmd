 **About me**  
NRC & NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Seattle, WA

 _Previously:_  
 PhD from Simon Fraser University  
 MSc from Moss Landing Marine Labs  
 BSc from University of North Carolina Wilmington  

--

**Background**  
macroecology, life history theory, (comparative) ecophysiology, phylogenetic comparative methods, bayesian modeling

--

**Research interests**  
I bridge macroecology with fisheries science to understand physiological, ecological, and evolutionary patterns across fishes (and other vertebrates). I mostly think about how environmental variation elicits these patterns and how these patterns (and fish) will change in the future as our climate changes. I am especially interested in the effects of oxygen and temperature on the ecology and evolution of fishes (size, abundance, distribution, life histories)

###This workshop will be an **introduction** to R

--

We will learn how to:
1. import a dataframe into R
2. examine and manipulate data
3. calculate summary statistics from a data frame
4. use ggplot to visualize data
5. begin analyzing data
6. edit ggplot themes to make a publication quality figure

--

**Your R journey does not end here. This is a beginner's course and there is much to learn. There are many online resources (how most people learn R, including myself)**

###Everyone should have R _and_ Rstudio downloaded and installed

--

This will be our first sticky note exercise: if you have successfully downloaded and installed R -and- Rstudio, please put a blue stick note on your laptop
